This zip file is from https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/ and contains County health data from each state.  If we look through it we may find some of the data interesting and could pull it together across states and do something with it.

county_health is the zip file downloaded from the above website.
FinalProjectData.R is an R program to read sheets of an Excel file and produce a csv with some of the fields and short names.  It can easily be improved to loop through all of the states and produce one big file.
raw_illinois4 is sheet 4 of the Illinois spreadsheet
raw_illinois5 is sheet 5 of the Illinois spreadsheet and has demographics.  It can easily be merged with sheet 4.
